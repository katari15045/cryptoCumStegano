1. Similar to Destination, transfer public key of source

2. Diffie Hellman from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#DH2Ex

3. pub_key_dst( priv_key_src("abc") ) --- try smaller key size for inner encryption

4. Make sure this application has forward secrecy - new Keys are generated at each session

5. Document the approach

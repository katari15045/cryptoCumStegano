1. Similar to Destination, transfer public key of source

2. Diffie Hellman from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#DH2Ex

3. pub_key_dst( priv_key_src("abc") ) --- try smaller key size for inner encryption

4. Make sure this application has forward secrecy - new Keys are generated at each session

5. Document the approach

6. While transferring the sym_key, first encr_with_src_priv_key("non-confidential data") to ensure accountability and then encr_with_dst_pub_key(sym_key) to ensure confidentiality, and finally encr_with_dst_pub_key( hash(sym_key) ) for integrity i.e ensuring all 4 properties of information security -

	Confidentiality
	Integrity
	Availability
	Non-repudiation (accountability)
